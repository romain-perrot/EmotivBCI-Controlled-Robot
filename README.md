# EmotivBCI-Controlled-Robot

Welcome to my EmotivBCI-Controlled-Robot project!

This project focuses on developing a BCI-controlled robotic assistant using the TIAGo++ robot parallel gripper from PAL Robotics and Emotiv's Epoch+ headset for object grasping tasks. By leveraging Emotiv's Epoch+ headset, I aim to enable intuitive control of robotic grasping through mental commands, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in assistive robotics.
