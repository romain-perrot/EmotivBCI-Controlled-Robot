# EmotivBCI-Controlled-Robot

Welcome to my EmotivBCI-Controlled-Robot project!

This project focuses on developing a BCI-controlled robotic assistant using the TIAGo++ robot parallel gripper from PAL Robotics and Emotiv's Epoch+ headset for object grasping tasks. By leveraging Emotiv's Epoch+ headset, I aim to enable intuitive control of robotic grasping through mental commands, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in assistive robotics.

## Overview

- [Introduction](docs/USAGE.md): Learn about the project and its objectives.
- [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md): Follow detailed instructions for setting up the development environment, including ROS, Node-RED, and other dependencies.
- [Explanation](docs/EXPLANATION.md): Detail the functionnalities of the project
- [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md): Get help with common issues and solutions.
- [References](docs/REFERENCES.md): Find additional resources and documentation.

## Project Structure

- `mind_control/`: Contains the source code for controlling the TIAGo++ robot using either the EmotivBCI machine learning model or a logistic regression model (both have to be trained with your mental images).
- `flows.json`: Node-RED flow configuration file.
